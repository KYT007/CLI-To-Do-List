#A Simple Python C.R.U.D. "To-Do List" program.

This program is a simple To-Do List style "CRUD" program written in the python programming language. It will start as a protoype program without persistent memory using simple list objects to store data in order to show understanding of concepts. Later this program will be updated to make use of SQLite database functionality to create a usable program. 

#Now uses SQLite3 database functionality for persistent memory.

As of 12/30/23, this program has been brought to closer to its intention of becoming a usable
CLI program with the addition of SQLite3 database functionality.
