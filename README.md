The program contained in this repository will be a C.R.U.D. type app I will be creating and continously adding to as 
I continue to learn more about the python programming language
and software engineering and development in general. This application will start out simple and be updates as I learn more;
As I learn databases, how to implement GUIs this program will grow and change.
