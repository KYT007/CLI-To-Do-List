The program contained in this repository will be a C.R.U.D. type app I will be creating and continously adding to as I continue to learn more about the python programming language
and software engineering. This application will start out simple and be updates as I expand my knowledebase.
As I learn the usage of databases, how to implement GUIs and similar concepts, this program will grow and change.

Update for SimpleCRUD.py 11/19/2023

***Fixed many errors with the base framework of the protoype program.
***Input validations using pyip were not implemented where they should have been. 
***Items were not being properly appended to storage as class objects as they were inteded to be.

read_item() function updated for errors, title() attribute was unneeded.
